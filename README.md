## Deliverables

As a user, I can:

1. See the quote received from the server, including its Character play, and
   comments when the page loads. You will need to make a GET request to the
   following endpoint to retrieve the image data, along with its associated
   comments:


2. Click on the speaker icon to listen to the audio version of the quote on the page. **No persistence is needed**.

3. Copy and paste new comment to the page when the comment form is submitted. **No
   persistence is needed**.
